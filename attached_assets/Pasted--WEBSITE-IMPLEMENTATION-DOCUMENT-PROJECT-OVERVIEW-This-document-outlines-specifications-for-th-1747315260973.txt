# WEBSITE IMPLEMENTATION DOCUMENT

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

This document outlines specifications for the creation of a personal academic and professional website that serves three key functions:

1. **Informational** - Introducing the individual, their values, and research direction
2. **Promotional** - Showcasing capabilities for potential collaborators or employers
3. **Scientific** - Supporting research on scientific discovery processes with interactive elements

The website follows a unique temporal structure (Future-Present-Past) that unfolds as users scroll, with progressive disclosure of information through expandable sections.

---

## SITE STRUCTURE

The website is organized into three distinct but flowing sections that correspond to different temporal dimensions:

### 1. THE FUTURE (Landing View)
The entry point focusing on vision, mission, and aspirations.

### 2. THE PRESENT (Timeline/Ongoing)
An interactive section showing current projects and recent activities.

### 3. THE PAST (Interactive CV)
An expandable curriculum vitae with personal and professional history.

A visual timeline element connects these sections for seamless navigation.

## VISUAL DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS

### Overall Design Philosophy
A clean, simple, and elegant design that emphasizes content while using visual elements to reinforce the past-present-future structure. The website should unfold as users scroll, with smooth transitions between temporal sections.

### Color Palette
- **Primary Colors**
  - Deep Blue (#1A365D) - Representing depth of thought and stability
  - Teal (#2A9D8F) - Representing innovation and growth
  - Warm Gray (#E8E8E4) - For background and neutral elements

- **Section-Specific Accent Colors**
  - Future Section: Bright Teal (#45C7B3) - forward-looking, optimistic
  - Present Section: Vibrant Blue (#3D87CB) - active, engaging
  - Past Section: Deep Navy (#0A2342) - established, foundational

### Typography
- **Headings:** Montserrat (sans-serif) - Clean, modern, authoritative
- **Body Text:** Source Sans Pro (sans-serif) - Highly readable, professional
- **Accent Text:** Georgia (serif) - Adds a classical touch for quotes or emphasis

### Layout Structure

#### THE FUTURE Section
- Full-width, open layout with significant white space
- Bold typography for the vision statement
- Gradient background shifting from dark to light (suggesting dawn/emergence)
- Email collection form appears prominently but not intrusively
- Subtle downward scroll indicators

#### THE PRESENT Section
- Card-based timeline with horizontal scrolling option for ongoing projects
- Visual timeline element becomes more pronounced
- More dynamic layout with interactive elements
- Content cards should have consistent sizing but allow for expansion
- Active/hover states for interactive elements

#### THE PAST Section
- Initially displays condensed CV information in a structured grid
- "See more" toggles reveal additional content in-place
- More formal, structured layout than the previous sections
- Clear visual hierarchy for different CV components
- Timeline visual element continues through this section

### Navigation Elements
- Persistent subtle timeline indicator along the side of the page showing all three sections
- Visual marker shows current position in the overall narrative
- Simple iconography to indicate content types and expandable sections
- "Return to top" button appears after scrolling past the fold

### Responsive Design Notes
- All sections should adapt gracefully to mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- Timeline may shift from horizontal to vertical orientation on smaller screens
- Card layouts should reflow appropriately for different screen widths
- Touch-friendly tap targets for mobile users
