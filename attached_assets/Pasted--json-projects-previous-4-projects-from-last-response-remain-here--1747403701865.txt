      "long_description": "This dissertation aims to understand and advance the methodology of scientific discovery. It uses Causal Discovery Methods (CDMs) as a lens to study and improve scientific practice, introduces Meta-Creative Problem-Solving (MCPS) as a novel theory of how scientists overcome ignorance at the frontiers of discovery, and pioneers a cognitive metascience investigation to improve theoretical practices in science. The three main theoretical contributions of this work are being developed as standalone papers (see related projects below).",

      "title": "Widespread Adoption of Causal Discovery Algorithms Through Theoretical Practice Checklist",
      "short_description": "Proposing a 'Theoretical Practice Checklist' to improve the trustworthiness and integration of Causal Discovery Algorithm (CDA) results in scientific practice.",
      "long_description": "This study aims for an impactful understanding of scientific discovery practice using Causal Discovery Algorithms (CDAs). Despite their potential, widespread CDA adoption is hindered by conceptual confusion and problems merging domain-specific theories with the causal framework, leading to uncertain trustworthiness of results. This paper develops a fundamental causal assumption to provide external validity criteria and a central methodological definition to synthesize debates on CDA outcome validity. Building on this, a 'Theoretical Practice Checklist' is proposed. This checklist allows for estimating confidence in CDA results, enriching peer-review, and fostering the iterative integration of theory-driven scientists with data-driven methods. The intended audience includes philosophers of science, scientists uncertain about using CDAs, and the CDA development community.",

      "short_description": "Introducing Meta-Creative Problem-Solving (MCPS), a new concept to study and improve inquiry practices as they become intelligent at the frontiers of knowledge.",
      "long_description": "At the frontier of knowledge, we often feel uncertain not just about a subject, but also about how to proceed with discovery. This work introduces Meta-Creative Problem-Solving (MCPS), a new concept designed to study and improve inquiry practices and norms as they become intelligent. MCPS involves generating variations within epistemic activities and evaluating consequent changes in relation to the subject of inquiry, guided by metacognitive feelings like confidence and fluency. It recognizes that (meta)epistemic practices themselves embody assumptions whose consequences guide their own refinement. The MCPS concept aims to answer how inquiry becomes intelligent, especially when no ready-made roadmap exists.",

      "long_description": "This project introduces a 'Cognitive Metascience' approach to systematically study and improve theoretical practices within scientific research, with an initial focus on Causal Discovery Method (CDM) applications. It leverages insights from Meta-Creative Problem-Solving (MCPS) to develop a neurosymbolic workflow for assessing the explicitness of theoretical traces, carefulness of practice, and quality of theoretical grounding. The aim is to provide validated guidelines and tools that enhance the quality, robustness, and impact of scientific endeavors by making theoretical work more transparent and effective. All modules for the workflow tool have been coded and are currently being assembled.",

Users can define variables and invite participants to add suspected causal relationships, specifying direction, strength, polarity, and their reasoning. The app also prompts users to assess their confidence in the absence of links they didn't specify. Finally, individual inputs are aggregated to generate a summary graph, highlighting areas of consensus and disagreement among researchers. This tool aims to streamline the crucial first step in formal causal modeling and discovery. If this tool could be useful for your current needs, please get in touch.",
